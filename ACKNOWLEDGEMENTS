Mimic is currently being developed and maintained by Mycroft AI, Inc.
Mycroft AI is the company behind the Mycroft artificial intelligence
and voice assistant platform, more info here: https://mycroft.ai

The initial development of Mimic was primarily done by awb through
the Flite project while he was traveling, perhaps the name is
doubly appropriate as a substantial amount of the coding was
done over 30,000ft).  During most of that time awb was funded
by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

Kevin A. Lenzo was involved in the design, conversion techniques and
representations for the voice distributed with Flite (as well as being
the actual kal voice itself).

The indic contribution was mainly done by Alok Parlikar.
